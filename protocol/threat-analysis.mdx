## Economic Attack Vectors

### 1. 51% Stake Attack

**Scenario**: Adversary acquires majority of staked tokens

**Impact**: Could control consensus outcomes

**Mitigations**:
- High stake requirements make this expensive
- Slashing reduces profitability of attack
- Reputation damage is permanent
- Community can fork if attack detected

**Cost Analysis**:
```
If total staked = 1M tokens
Attack requires >500K tokens
Plus: slashing risk, opportunity cost
```

### 2. Verifier Cartel

**Scenario**: Group of verifiers coordinate scores

**Impact**: Manipulated reputation and rewards

**Mitigations**:
- Randomized committee selection
- MAD-based outlier rejection
- Multiple independent verifiers required
- On-chain audit trail enables detection

### 3. Score Manipulation for Bribes

**Scenario**: Worker bribes verifiers for high scores

**Impact**: Undeserved rewards and reputation

**Mitigations**:
- Anonymous commit-reveal hides scores
- Multiple verifiers must be bribed
- Outlier detection catches suspicious patterns
- Honest verifiers profit from accurate scores

## Technical Attack Vectors

### 4. Front-Running Attacks

**Scenario**: Copy others' scores after seeing them

**Impact**: Free-riding on honest work

**Mitigations**:
- Commit-reveal protocol
- Hash includes randomness
- Commits timestamped on-chain

### 5. Evidence Manipulation

**Scenario**: Modify evidence after submission

**Impact**: False claims of work quality

**Mitigations**:
- DataHash commits to evidence root
- Merkle proofs verify inclusion
- Immutable storage (Arweave)
- DKG signatures prevent tampering

### 6. Timestamp Manipulation

**Scenario**: Backdate nodes in DKG

**Impact**: False causal claims

**Mitigations**:
- VLC makes ancestry tampering detectable
- Tolerance limits on clock drift
- On-chain anchoring of timestamps
- Multiple verifiers check consistency

### 7. Sybil Identities

**Scenario**: Create many fake agent IDs

**Impact**: Artificially boost reputation

**Mitigations**:
- ERC-8004 registration requires unique address
- Stake per identity raises cost
- New accounts have low reputation weight
- Pattern detection in scoring

## Operational Attack Vectors

### 8. DoS on Verifiers

**Scenario**: Overwhelm verifiers with submissions

**Impact**: Delayed verification, missed epochs

**Mitigations**:
- Fee market for submissions
- Rate limiting per address
- Committee sampling limits workload
- Multiple verifier networks

### 9. Evidence Withholding

**Scenario**: Submit hash but hide evidence

**Impact**: Cannot verify claims

**Mitigations**:
- Evidence availability requirements
- Multiple storage providers required
- Challenge-response mechanism
- Slashing for unavailable evidence

### 10. Griefing Attacks

**Scenario**: Submit invalid work to waste verifier time

**Impact**: Increased costs for verifiers

**Mitigations**:
- Submission fees
- Stake slashing for invalid submissions
- Quick pre-verification checks
- Reputation requirements for submission

## Attack Scenarios

### Scenario A: Malicious Worker

```
1. Alice submits fabricated work evidence
2. Creates fake DKG with inflated contributions
3. Verifiers audit and detect inconsistencies
4. Causal audit fails (missing signatures, broken VLC)
5. Work rejected, Alice loses stake
```

### Scenario B: Verifier Collusion

```
1. Eve and Mallory collude to inflate Bob's scores
2. They coordinate to submit [95, 95, 95, 95, 95]
3. Honest verifiers submit [70, 75, 72, 80, 78]
4. MAD-based aggregation:
   - Median: ~75
   - MAD: ~3
   - Eve/Mallory's 95s are >3×MAD away
   - Their scores are rejected as outliers
5. Consensus reflects honest verifiers
6. Eve/Mallory are slashed for deviation
```

### Scenario C: Bribery Attack

```
1. Worker offers verifiers $100 to score 90+
2. Commit-reveal means verifiers can't see others' commits
3. Some accept bribe, some don't
4. On reveal:
   - Bribed verifiers: [92, 94, 91]
   - Honest verifiers: [70, 72, 68, 71]
5. Bribed verifiers are outliers → slashed
6. Bribery cost + slashing loss > potential gain
```

## Detection Mechanisms

| Attack | Detection Method |
|--------|------------------|
| Score manipulation | Statistical analysis of score distributions |
| Collusion | Pattern analysis across multiple tasks |
| Sybils | Graph analysis of relationships |
| Evidence fabrication | DKG integrity verification |
| Timestamp manipulation | VLC verification |

## Security Monitoring

### On-Chain Metrics

- Score distribution per verifier
- Slashing frequency
- Committee composition over time
- Evidence availability rates

### Off-Chain Monitoring

- Verifier behavior patterns
- Network communication analysis
- Storage provider availability
- Cross-reference with external data
